# docker-golang-builder

An image that can build a go source repository.  All built artifacts
from `GOPATH/bin` will be put into `/usr/local/bin`.  The golang
compiler is removed from the resulting image, as is any source
installed by `go get`.

Available as [pallet/golang-builder][pallet-golang-builder].

## Usage

You should use this image to build your own images using a Dockerfile.
For example, to build an image for [helixdns][helixdns], you would
create a `Dockerfile` that looks like:

```
FROM pallet/golang-builder
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/helixdns"]
```

The repository to be built needs to be specified in a docker build
bundle file, named `gorepo` (ie. a file namedd `gorepo` in the same
directory as your `Dockerfile`).  The `gorepo` file must be a shell
script that sets the `GOREPO` environment variable to something that
`go get` will understand.

For the helixdns example, this would be:

```
GOREPO=github.com/mrwilson/helixdns
```

Running `docker build` on this `Dockerfile` results in an image that
contains the helixdns executable in `/usr/local/bin`, and no golang
compiler or sources.
